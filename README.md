# Password-Generator

## Website Summary

Welcome to my website where you can generate a random password! You have the option to customize your password by choosing to include: numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and special characters. By utilizing javascript I was able to take user responses to provide this customization. Finding a functional and efficient way to go about this code was a huge challenge. Eventually I came upon checking conditions as a means to concatinate the string that would ultimately be randomly selected from. This page is currently able to provide a clickable button that will generate and display a password. Additional features were included to ensure that a minimum and maximum password length was selected and that at least one password customization was selected as well. In the future I would like to add additional verification features on whether or not the password generated contains at least one of each type of character.
